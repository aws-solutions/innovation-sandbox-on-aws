title: Edit Lease Budget Settings
---

Update spending limits and budget thresholds for this active lease.

---

**Maximum Spend**: Set or modify the spending limit. Your organization may enforce a global maximum.

**Budget Thresholds**: Configure automated actions at specific spending levels:

- **Alert**: Sends email notification
- **Freeze Lease**: Prevents new resource creation (existing resources continue running)

---

_Note: Changes take effect immediately. If the lease was frozen due to reaching a budget threshold, consider increasing the budget before unfreezing._

For more information, see [Budget thresholds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/manager-guide.html#budget-thresholds) in the implementation guide.
