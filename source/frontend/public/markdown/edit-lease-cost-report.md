title: Edit Lease Cost Report Settings
---

Update the cost allocation group for this active lease.

---

**Cost Report Group**: When assigned, the lease is included in custom cost reports that are generated and delivered to an S3 bucket. This enables detailed cost tracking and chargeback by department, project, or team.

Your organization may require all leases to have a cost report group assigned.
