title: Edit Budget Settings
---

Configure spending limits and budget thresholds for leases.

---

**Maximum Budget**: Set a spending limit. Your organization may enforce a global maximum.

**Budget Thresholds**: Configure automated actions at specific spending levels:

- **Alert**: Sends email notification
- **Freeze Account**: Prevents new resource creation (existing resources continue running)

---

_Note: Changes apply to new leases only. Existing leases keep their original budget settings._
