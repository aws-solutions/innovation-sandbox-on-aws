title: Edit Cost Report Settings
---

Assign leases to a cost allocation group for financial tracking and reporting.

---

**Cost Report Group**: When assigned, leases are included in custom cost reports that are generated and delivered to an S3 bucket. This enables detailed cost tracking and chargeback by department, project, or team.

Your organization may require all templates to have a cost report group assigned.

---

_Note: Changes apply to new leases only. Existing leases keep their original cost report group._
